# Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs) Dynamic Population Model 

Please note that this is the _development_ version of the repository. The _development_ version allows researchers to experiment with features, parameters, and changes to the model without breaking accompanying tools that may rely on the model code or outputs. 

The development version of the DPM is distinct from the production version, which is used for the GBADs Modeller User Interface tool. Not all releases are available in the GBADs Modeller tool; please see the website for more details on public facing and interactive modelling.
